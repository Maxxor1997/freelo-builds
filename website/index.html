		<h1> What It Does </h1>
		<p> freelo builds is a League of Legends helper program that assists in determining what item is the best for
		you to build next, given your current in game situation. Our Java program runs in the background while 
		you play. The only thing the program requires is for you to press the open bracket ( [ ) if you are blue side or close bracket ( ] ) if you are red side, and to drag your champion to the top of the scoreboard.
		When you want to find out what to build next, hold tab to bring up the scoreboard and press 
		the backslash ( \ ) key. Our program will take a screenshot of the scoreboard and analyze your current 
		in-game situation. Once it knows the situation, it accesses a database of winrates for items from past
		games with similar situations, and it recommends the highest winrate item to build next. The name of the
		item is said using text-to-speech by the program so you can figure out what to build without ever
		diverting your attention away from the game.<p>
